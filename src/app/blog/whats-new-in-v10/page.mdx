Hello to all the Superusers out there! We are announcing the release of SudoBot v10.0 Delicious Donut! üç© <br />
This is a major release with a bunch of new features, important fixes and improvements.
Here is a list of changes in this release:

## New Features & Improvements

-   **Archive command**: You can now use the `-archive` command to archive a channel.
-   **Discord.js v14.16.1**: SudoBot now uses Discord.js v14.16.1, which supports user-installable applications.
    That means, now we can move forward with the user-installable applications feature.
-   **One step forward to supporting Windows**: We are working on supporting Windows.
    We have made some changes in the codebase to make it compatible with Windows to some extent.
-   **Verification System**: A customizable, channel based verification system that attempts to verify users on a button click.
-   **Improved AI Based Auto Moderation**: SudoBot can now observe user behavior and take appropriate actions based on the behavior.

## Bug Fixes

-   **Fixed privilege escalation vulnerability**: We've fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability in the bot.
    For this, we've deprecated all versions of v9.0 prior to v9.26.7. It is highly recommended to update your bot to the latest version.
    For more details, check out [CVE-2024-45307](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-45307).
-   **Fixed command parsing and management**: We've fixed the issue where commands won't execute if there is a newline after the command name.

## Deprecations & Upgrades

-   **Bun &lt;= v1.1.16**: We have deprecated Bun versions older than v1.1.16.
-   **TypeScript v5.5.3**: The minimum TypeScript version required to compile SudoBot is now v5.5.3.

## Refactorings

-   **Refactored the command handler**: We've refactored the command handler to make it more efficient and maintainable.

## How to update?

SudoBot v10.0 is backward compatible with v9.0. You can update your bot by running the following command if you use Git:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you don't use Git, you can download the latest release from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/sudobot/releases/latest).
