# Auto Moderation

SudoBot is packed with lots of different automatic moderation tools to make moderating your server easier.<br />
Just in case if you see that there's a feature you'd like but is not implemented yet, please be sure to let us know by creating an issue at GitHub!

## What can the bot do?

* Filtering Messages with Message Rules (by words, tokens, literals, regex patterns, files, and a lot more!)
* Auto Triggers 
* AI Auto Moderation and Rule-violating Message Detection

We're frequently adding new things, so you might see something new soon!
