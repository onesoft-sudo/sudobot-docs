# Frequently Asked Questions

Here is a collection of questions that are asked frequently. Let us know if you think we're missing something.

### Why do I get errors when running `npm start`?

The reasons might be:

-   You forgot to install the dependencies by running: `npm install -D`
-   You forgot to build the bot: `npm run build`
-   The bot started up but one of the configuration value is invalid. See [Why am I getting errors when starting the bot?](#why-am-i-getting-errors-when-starting-the-bot).

We always recommend to check the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page if you're using the bot for the first time.

### Why am I getting errors when starting the bot?

The reasons might be:

-   You have a syntax error in one of your configuration files (`config.json` or `system.json`). Double check your JSON syntax. Editors and IDEs like VS Code should highlight the errors if you have any.
-   You have set an option to an invalid value. In that case, check the error message for more information about which option received the invalid value.
-   You have an invalid value in one of the environment variables or in `.env`. For example, maybe you have a typo in your database URL. Double check all the credentials.

If none of these steps help, please be sure to let us know, by creating a GitHub issue.

### How do I add emojis in the bot's responses?

Download the official SudoBot emojis and add them to your **home server**: [https://downloads.onesoftnet.eu.org/osn/sudo/emojis](https://downloads.onesoftnet.eu.org/osn/sudo/emojis).<br />
