# About SudoBot

In March of 2022, SudoBot was born. It was written by [Ar Rakin](https://github.com/virtual-designer) (pronounced `/ɑːr ræˈkiːn/`), in JavaScript. But after a few months, it was rewritten in TypeScript since types make code easy to debug and maintain. We had only one goal for building the bot, and that is to support [The Free Software Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement). We have a different view compared to other popular Discord Bots available. We've made the bot free and open source, proudly. It respects the end-users' freedom. Anyone can contribute and improve the bot, provided that they abide by the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The bot has features that you will find really handy when it comes to Discord Server Moderation. Because SudoBot is a result of our own experiences and ways to moderate servers more productively, written in lines of code. We added the things we felt a need for.

SudoBot was free, is free and will remain free and open source forever.

## What does "SudoBot" mean?

SudoBot is the combination of "sudo" and "bot". "sudo" is a widely known and used program in the Unix/Linux ecosystems to do administrative tasks. It means "Substitute User Do". However, in case of SudoBot, "sudo" means "Super User Do". Since SudoBot is a moderation bot and moderators are those who usually have special permissions (or "super powers"), we've considered them as "Super Users", and thus the name.
