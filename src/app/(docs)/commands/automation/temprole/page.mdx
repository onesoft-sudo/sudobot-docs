# `temprole`

Temporarily gives a role to a member.

## Notes

If you don't specify a unit of time like s, m, h, etc, it will default to seconds. So if you put 100 by itself, it will put it down as 100 seconds.

### Syntax

```
-temprole [time] [user] [role]
/temprole member: [member] role: [role] duration: [how long you want user to have role for] start_after: [time] (OPTIONAL)
```

### Required Permissions

`ManageRoles`

### Modes

<Modes modes={["legacy", "interaction"]} />

### Examples

```
-temprole 10m @ninsacc @Role 1
/temprole member: @ninsacc role: @Role 2 duration: 10m start_after: 1m
```
