# `schedule`

Sends a message after the given timeframe.

## Notes

If you don't specify a unit of time like s, m, h, etc, it will default to seconds. So if you put 100 by itself, it will put it down as 100 seconds.

### Syntax

```
-schedule <time_interval> [content]
/schedule content: [content] time_interval: [time_interval] channel: [channel] (OPTIONAL)
```

### Required Permissions

`ManageMessages`

### Modes

<Modes modes={["legacy", "interaction"]} />

### Examples

```
-schedule 20m Code that one file you need to make!
/schedule time_interval: 20m content: Code a file! channel: general
```
