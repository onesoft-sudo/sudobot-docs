# Why did the bot in my server get terminated?

Probably because your server violated the Terms of SudoBot. Violation of the [Terms of Service](terms.md) is not acceptable and may cause termination without prior notice. It's not possible to appeal once your server gets terminated.

We always expect fair usage of the bot and other services provided by OSN Developers Team.

After all these, OSN Developers reserve the right to terminate your access to the bot at any time, for any reason.
