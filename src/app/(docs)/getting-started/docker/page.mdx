# Getting Started with Docker

Docker is a tool that allows you to package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This makes it easy to deploy applications in a consistent and reproducible way.
In this guide, you'll learn how to set up SudoBot using Docker.

Using docker also allows you to run SudoBot on any platform that supports Docker, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
The GitHub repository contains a `Dockerfile` that you can use to build a Docker image for SudoBot. 
It also contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to run SudoBot in a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the SudoBot repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/sudobot
```

## Set Up Configuration and Environment Variables

Create a `.env.docker` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:root@postgres:5432/sudobot
SUDO_PREFIX=/app/storage

# Add other variables here...
```

Take a look at the [environment variables](/getting-started#environment-variables) section for more information.

After this, create a new directory named `storage` in the project root and copy the `config` directory from the project root to `storage`.

## Building and Starting the Docker Image

To build and start SudoBot, you can use `docker-compose`. It will automatically pull the required images and start the containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will build the Docker image and start the SudoBot container in the background. Remove the `-d` flag if you want to see the logs in the terminal.
As always, you can tweak the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to suit your needs.
